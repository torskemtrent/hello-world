First Repo

Hello here 
This would be my first repo and I look forward to working with everyone here..no one is perfect, better, but we are a gradual process of reaching that perfection

I may not be good at coding or design..so looking forward to your corrections whenever you spot an error in what I might have written as a code or it might be correct but can be adjusted to make it shorter, easier and better to read and adjust

Thank you all

God bless
